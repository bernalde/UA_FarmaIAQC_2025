One solution is to formulate the problem as a mathematical optimization problem where the optimal solution corresponds to the most likely ligand-protein configuration. This optimization problem can be solved on a quantum computer using methods like the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). This tutorial demonstrates how this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04098) used digitized-counteradiabatic (DC) QAOA to study molecular docking.
